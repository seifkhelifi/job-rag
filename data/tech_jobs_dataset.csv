We're driven by the opportunity to reimagine what it's like to drive and make travel safer, less stressful, and more enjoyable for everyone.



When you join the Latitude team, you'll work alongside leading experts across machine learning and robotics, cloud platforms, mapping, sensors and compute systems, test operations, systems and safety engineering – ***all dedicated to making a real, positive impact on the driving experience for millions of people.***



As a Ford Motor Company subsidiary, we operate independently to develop automated driving technology at the speed of a technology startup. Latitude is headquartered in Pittsburgh with engineering centers in Dearborn, Mich., and Palo Alto, Calif.


**Meet the team:**



The Virtual Test Ecosystem (VTE) team is responsible for implementing the tooling used by Latitude to perform simulations (pure virtual scenarios where we can control interactions and sweep over permutations via a descriptive scenario language) and resimulations (rerunning logs collected on\\-vehicle using an updated version of the autonomy stack). This includes the backend C\\+\\+ simulation/resimulation frameworks that call the underlying autonomy tasks and Python\\-based tooling to run this at large scale in the cloud. This infrastructure enables us to do a large portion of testing before the code ever makes it on vehicle, dramatically reducing autonomy developer iteration time and allowing us to perform large scale safety testing.



We work closely and iteratively with autonomy teams to build out new sim/resim features that they need in order to evaluate their new autonomy features. Similarly, we work hand\\-in\\-hand with the offboard testing teams who are building out test coverage to ensure they can use our tooling to write the tests they need and to get feedback on how we can make this test creation more efficient. And of course we're constantly benchmarking and evaluating the efficiency and scalability of our applications in order to reduce runtimes and cost.


**What you'll do:**


* Add new features needed by autonomy teams and/or testing to the core C\\+\\+ simulation / resimulation framework. This could be a more complex interaction with other actors or some feature of the map. It could also be simulating a new portion of the autonomy stack, or intentionally introducing a degradation to some portion of the stack in order to determine how downstream components react
* Work directly with autonomy and testing teams to understand their needs and pain points, then internally propose features we can add to improve our infrastructure and/or simulation realism
* Support troubleshooting with users and bug fixes when issues are identified; we work with a variety of users on a daily basis
* Analyze simulation/resimulation reproducibility (does running the same code multiple times result in the exact same behavior?) and develop tooling to root\\-cause whether nondeterminism is coming from autonomy tasks or from the simulation/resimulation code
* Learn the autonomy stack at a level of depth that allows you to reason about what the best way is to wire in new autonomy features as they're developed, to be able to do some initial root\\-causing of crashes or issues to isolate what's going wrong (at which point the associated autonomy team would implement the actual fix), and in general to be an effective bridge between our team and the autonomy teams


**What you'll need to succeed:**


* Expertise in modern C\\+\\+ (C\\+\\+17\\)
* Self\\-driven to write code that's efficient, well\\-tested, well\\-documented, and conforms to our style guide
* 3\\+ years' experience with developing software for autonomous vehicles
* 1\\+ years' experience with developing software for some sort of simulation environment
* Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Robotics or a related field and 4\\+ years of relevant experience (or Master's degree and 2\\+ years of relevant experience, or PhD)
* Strong communication skills and desire to partner with internal and external team members in order to create solutions that robustly solve the problem and allow us to evaluate the safety and performance of new features


**Nice to have:**


* Python development experience
* AWS or similar cloud experience


**What we offer you:**


* Competitive compensation packages
* High\\-quality individual and family medical, dental, and vision insurance
* Health savings account with available employer match
* Employer\\-matched 401(k) retirement plan with immediate vesting
* Employer\\-paid group term life insurance and the option to elect voluntary life insurance
* Paid parental leave

Non\\-Exempt new hires accrue up to 16 days of vacation time off each year, at a rate of 4\\.92 hours per pay period. Exempt new hires participate in Cisco’s flexible Vacation Time Off policy, which does not place a defined limit on how much vacation time eligible employees may use, but is subject to availability and some business limitations. All new hires are eligible for Sick Time Off subject to Cisco’s Sick Time Off Policy and will have eighty (80\\) hours of sick time off provided on their hire date and on January 1st of each year thereafter. Up to 80 hours of unused sick time will be carried forward from one calendar year to the next such that the maximum number of sick time hours an employee may have available is 160 hours.

We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community.


Employees on sales plans earn performance\\-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non\\-quota components. For quota\\-based incentive pay, Cisco typically pays as follows:


.75% of incentive target for each 1% of revenue attainment up to 50% of quota;


1\\.5% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 50% and 75%;


1% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 75% and 100%; and once performance exceeds 100% attainment, incentive rates are at or above 1% for each 1% of attainment with no cap on incentive compensation.


For non\\-quota\\-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.",nan,"https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Cisco","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/b799172fd63cfb12d47f7d0f8f79a90b","http://www.cisco.com","San Jose, CA","10,000+","more than $10B (USD)","Cisco wants you to bring your uniqueness, join teams to solve challenges, and work together to build an inclusive future for all with our technology.

The ideal candidate isn't just a skilled engineer they're a builder who sees beyond code to understand the larger business and human impact of their work.
   

  

**About Us**
 Waterlily uses AI to help families prepare for the largest financial and medical event in their lives, long\\-term care (LTC). Through comprehensive care planning and optimization, Waterlily is bending Americas multi\\-trillion dollar LTC cost curve.
   

  

 Our Team \\& Culture

 Our team comprises some of the brightest, most ambitious, playful, and friendly people youll meet. You'll be working closely with our founding Waterlily team, including Lily, Evan, Job, and Tim, and have direct access to a support team in the Philippines.
   

  

* Lily Vittayarukskul, our CEO, is a patented inventor who started college at 14, attending UC Berkeley, was working at NASA when she was 16, and lead product and engineering at IoT medical device startups for years before founding Waterlily.
* Evan Ehrenberg, our COO, is a member of Forbes 30 Under 30, started college at 11, also attending UC Berkeley, and then continued on to his Ph.D. in computational neuroscience at MIT at 16 before dropping out at 21 to found Clara Health, a clinical trials SaaS platform and B2B2C marketplace, which he sold 7 years later before joining Waterlily.
* Our founding engineer and data scientist, Tim Chung, holds a Masters of Computer Science from UPenn and is midway through a Data Science Masters at Georgia Tech. Tim excels in a trio of roles: data scientist, machine learning engineer, and full\\-stack software engineer. At his previous companies, he led teams to launch pioneering machine learning models.
* Our head of operations, Job Lawrence, holds a Masters from Harvard and MBA from the University of Michigan, worked directly alongside Sundar Pichai at early Google for over 10 years where he led strategy and operations, and has run finance, strategy, and ops for startups ranging from the earliest founding stages through Series D funding and beyond.


 How We Work
   

  

* We optimize for remote\\-first collaboration while maintaining high productivity
* We emphasize contextual decision\\-making and practical solutions
* We prioritize deep work and focused execution over unnecessary meetings
* We consistently validate that we're working on the highest\\-impact initiatives
* We maintain a healthy, growth\\-oriented mindset while pushing for exceptional results


 We're looking for teammates who share our values of integrity, empathy, and intelligent hard work \\- people who can see beyond their immediate role to understand both company needs and customer impact.
   

  

**About You**
**Growth Mindset \\& Adaptability**
* You're a ""potato"" \\- able to grow and thrive under any circumstances
* You have a track record of rapidly learning new technologies and business domains
* You see challenges as opportunities and adapt quickly to changing priorities
* You're comfortable with ambiguity and can make swift, informed decisions


**Innovation \\& Execution**
* You have a history of building solutions that challenge traditional approaches
* You can point to specific examples where you've used automation or AI to multiply your impact
* You focus on getting things done rather than achieving perfection on the first try
* You have experience or strong interest in leveraging LLMs and offshore teams as force multipliers


**Leadership \\& Communication**
* You give and receive direct feedback with grace and professionalism
* You can clearly explain complex technical concepts to non\\-technical stakeholders
* You're comfortable leading discussions and driving decisions
* You naturally build trust through transparency and reliable execution


**Mission Alignment**
* You're drawn to meaningful work that impacts families' lives
* You understand that sustained high performance requires maintaining personal wellbeing
* You're excited about joining a team that values both ambitious goals and sustainable pace
* You're genuinely interested in transforming how families prepare for long\\-term care


 The Ideal Background
   

  

 While we value potential over experience, you likely have:
   

  

* Demonstrated ability to own and deliver full\\-stack projects end\\-to\\-end
* Experience with modern web development frameworks and cloud architecture
* Track record of improving team efficiency through automation and process innovation
* History of taking initiative and driving results without extensive oversight


 We're not looking for someone who's done it all before we're looking for someone who has the raw talent and drive to help us pioneer new approaches to software development and team collaboration. If you're excited about pushing boundaries, learning rapidly, and making a real difference in people's lives, we want to talk to you.
   

  

**About The Role**
 You will be tasked with owning and scaling mission\\-critical features across the entire software stack. The goal will be to push beyond industry best\\-practices in software development by innovating new strategies that leverage LLMs and offshore teams to achieve company\\-defining results for a fraction of the time and cost of what other companies have previously achieved.
   

  

 You will be working with our founding US\\-based team and report directly to our co\\-founder and COO, Evan Ehrenberg, and you will grow to work with and support the management of a team of 40\\+ in the Philippines. You will collaborate on new ideas and implement quickly to test and iterate. Many ideas will not work and will be thrown away. Many ideas will need to be imperfect so that we can implement them faster. Everything will be iterative, no challenge will be too ambitious.
   

  

 You will be challenged to produce meaningful results every week. It will likely take you more than 40 hours per week to drive industry\\-leading results. We do not think that 80 hour weeks are sustainable or effective in the long run, and so while there may be incredibly important times where we mutually decide to be opportunistic to push ourselves to that amount of work to accomplish something very time sensitive, we expect you to generally limit yourself to 50\\-60 hour work\\-weeks. If you want to push harder we will urge you to reflect on ways to be more effective with your time so that you can dedicate your remaining time to benefit your mental and physical health.
   

  

 We will be in the trenches with you, and together we will create one of the most impactful companies that will help families prepare for what has historically been one of the most devastating times in their lives so that they can face long\\-term care with confidence and calm.

As an ML Engineer, you will work on incorporating large language models (LLMs), embeddings, and other AI technologies into Notion’s product in a high quality way. You’ll be exploring the boundaries of what’s possible with ML technology and finding innovative ways to apply new industry learnings to Notion’s offering.
   

  

**What You'll Achieve**
* Work with the team to prototype and experiment with AI model quality improvements, either by fine tuning, prompt engineering, or building new models when needed
* Productionize and launch new AI technology integrations into Notion’s core product
* Collaborate with cross\\-functional teams to deliver product features on time
* Stay up\\-to\\-date with the latest AI technologies and trends


**Skills You'll Need To Bring**
* Domain Expert, Teacher and Learner: You have experience building AI products using LLMs, embeddings or other ML natural language technologies. 3\\+ years of experience in one or more of the following areas: machine learning, recommendation or ranking systems, natural language understanding/generation or artificial intelligence. You’re excited about bringing your pre\\-existing knowledge to the team, but you balance that with perpetual curiosity and understanding that there is always more to learn.
* Holistic Problem Solver: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building.
* Communicate with Care: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross\\-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth and the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.
* Impact Driven: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Work isn't a solo endeavor for you, and you enjoy collaborating cross\\-functionally to accomplish shared goals.


**Nice To Haves**
* You understand how parts of a system fit together, from the user interface to the data model. You are familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL, and have experience building products from ground up.
* You’re proficient with data pipeline technologies: Spark, DBT, etc
* You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.
* You have experience driving teams toward shared goals and can balance business priorities with individuals’ strengths, areas of interest, and career development goals.
* You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
* You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or literature.


 We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

 We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
   

  

 We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
   

  

 Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays \\& Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
   

  

**About The Role**
 We are looking for an AI Product Engineer to join our small but nimble AI team whose mission is to make Notion an AI\\-powered product. As an AI Product Engineer, you will work on developing and implementing AI\\-powered products, incorporating large language models (LLMs), embeddings, and other AI technologies into Notion’s product.
   

  

**What You’ll Achieve**
* Work with the team to prototype and experiment with new AI features
* Productionize and launch new AI technology integrations into Notion’s core product
* Collaborate with cross\\-functional teams to deliver product features on time
* Stay up\\-to\\-date with the latest AI technologies and trends


**Skills You'll Need To Bring**
* Expertise building and prototyping: You have experience building AI products using LLMs, embeddings and other ML technologies. You understand how parts of a system fit together from UI to data model, are familiar with relational databases like Postgres or MySQL, and have experience building products from ground up.
* Shipping quality user interfaces: You partner closely with product and design to craft beautiful user experiences for large audiences, leveraging web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern UI framework like React.
* Problem\\-solving: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building.
* Empathetic communication and collaboration: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross\\-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth and the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.
* Impact\\-orientation and user focus: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Work isn't a solo endeavor for you, and you enjoy collaborating cross\\-functionally to accomplish shared goals.


**Nice To Haves**
* You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.
* You have experience driving teams toward shared goals and can balance business priorities with individuals’ strengths, areas of interest, and career development goals.
* You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
* You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.


 We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

 The Arc Institute is a new scientific institution that conducts curiosity\\-driven basic science and technology development to understand and treat complex human diseases. Headquartered in Palo Alto, California, Arc is an independent research organization founded on the belief that many important research programs will be enabled by new institutional models. Arc operates in partnership with Stanford University, UCSF, and UC Berkeley.
 


  


 While the prevailing university research model has yielded many tremendous successes, we believe in the importance of institutional experimentation as a way to make progress. These include:
 


  

  
* ****Funding:****
 Arc will fully fund Core Investigators’ (PIs’) research groups, liberating scientists from the typical constraints of project\\-based external grants.
  
* ****Technology:****
 Biomedical research has become increasingly dependent on complex tooling. Arc Technology Centers develop, optimize and deploy rapidly advancing experimental and computational technologies in collaboration with Core Investigators.
  
* ****Support:****
 Arc aims to provide first\\-class support—operationally, financially and scientifically—that will enable scientists to pursue long\\-term high risk, high reward research that can meaningfully advance progress in disease cures, including neurodegeneration, cancer, and immune dysfunction.

After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.
   

  

 So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.
   

  

 Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise\\-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.
   

  

**The Role**
 As a member of the Square Point of Sale Data Science team, you will use statistical, machine learning, analytics, and data engineering techniques to empower decision\\-making for Square’s new unified point of sale product. Over the past year, one of Square’s top strategic bets has been to converge a disparate set of POS apps into a single one that can serve a large and diverse set of sellers, in turn delivering tremendous business value. As this team continues to scale and build, there will be numerous ways for data science to generate additional impact, such as strategic sizing of opportunities, data foundations/instrumentation, operationalizing new metrics, evaluating the incremental impact of new launches, leveraging machine learning to carry out segmentation/generate predictive insights, and collaborating with other orgs across Square.
   

  

**You Will**
* Partner with the Square Point of Sale team to make data\\-informed decisions that have significant impact;
* Apply a diverse set of techniques including statistical analysis, machine learning (ML), analytics, business intelligence (dashboarding), and data engineering to generate strategic insights;
* Collaborate with the broader Square Data org to drive seller value and overall technical excellence;
* Communicate analysis and recommendations to high\\-level business partners in verbal, visual, and written forms;
* Develop resources and collaboration processes to empower data access and self\\-service so that your expertise can be leveraged where it is most impactful.


**You Have**
* Bachelor’s degree or equivalent in a quantitative discipline;
* 3\\+ years of data science experience or equivalent;
* Fluency with Python and SQL;
* Solid statistical foundations (e.g. A/B testing);
* Familiarity with standard machine learning concepts (e.g. regression/classification, clustering, offline/online model evaluation) and curiosity to learn more modern techniques as required;
* Familiarity with data engineering best practices;
* Experience leading cross\\-functional projects and partnering with Product/Marketing/Design/Engineering/UX Research on strategy and prioritization;
* Excellent verbal and written communication.
* Experience working in the payments or SaaS domain (Nice to have).

**Meet the team:**



The Virtual Test Ecosystem (VTE) team is responsible for implementing the tooling used by Latitude to perform simulations (pure virtual scenarios where we can control interactions and sweep over permutations via a descriptive scenario language) and resimulations (rerunning logs collected on\\-vehicle using an updated version of the autonomy stack). This includes the backend C\\+\\+ simulation/resimulation frameworks that call the underlying autonomy tasks and Python\\-based tooling to run this at large scale in the cloud. This infrastructure enables us to do a large portion of testing before the code ever makes it on vehicle, dramatically reducing autonomy developer iteration time and allowing us to perform large scale safety testing.



We work closely and iteratively with autonomy teams to build out new sim/resim features that they need in order to evaluate their new autonomy features. Similarly, we work hand\\-in\\-hand with the offboard testing teams who are building out test coverage to ensure they can use our tooling to write the tests they need and to get feedback on how we can make this test creation more efficient. And of course we're constantly benchmarking and evaluating the efficiency and scalability of our applications in order to reduce runtimes and cost.


**What you'll do:**


* Add new features needed by autonomy teams and/or testing to the core C\\+\\+ simulation / resimulation framework. This could be a more complex interaction with other actors or some feature of the map. It could also be simulating a new portion of the autonomy stack, or intentionally introducing a degradation to some portion of the stack in order to determine how downstream components react
* Work directly with autonomy and testing teams to understand their needs and pain points, then internally propose features we can add to improve our infrastructure and/or simulation realism
* Support troubleshooting with users and bug fixes when issues are identified; we work with a variety of users on a daily basis
* Analyze simulation/resimulation reproducibility (does running the same code multiple times result in the exact same behavior?) and develop tooling to root\\-cause whether nondeterminism is coming from autonomy tasks or from the simulation/resimulation code
* Learn the autonomy stack at a level of depth that allows you to reason about what the best way is to wire in new autonomy features as they're developed, to be able to do some initial root\\-causing of crashes or issues to isolate what's going wrong (at which point the associated autonomy team would implement the actual fix), and in general to be an effective bridge between our team and the autonomy teams


**What you'll need to succeed:**


* Expertise in modern C\\+\\+ (C\\+\\+17\\)
* Self\\-driven to write code that's efficient, well\\-tested, well\\-documented, and conforms to our style guide
* 3\\+ years' experience with developing software for autonomous vehicles
* 1\\+ years' experience with developing software for some sort of simulation environment
* Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Robotics or a related field and 4\\+ years of relevant experience (or Master's degree and 2\\+ years of relevant experience, or PhD)
* Strong communication skills and desire to partner with internal and external team members in order to create solutions that robustly solve the problem and allow us to evaluate the safety and performance of new features


**Nice to have:**


* Python development experience
* AWS or similar cloud experience


**What we offer you:**


* Competitive compensation packages

Lumafield was founded in 2019 to upgrade manufacturing.  

  

We are engineers with deep experience across the product development cycle, from initial ideas to shipping hardware, across industries and specializations, who became frustrated by the cost and complexity of modern manufacturing. So we decided to upgrade it.  

  

Engineers make million\\-dollar decisions every day, and they need tools that give them the greatest possible insight into their products. By offering unprecedented visibility into products, as well as AI\\-driven tools that highlight problems and generate quantitative data, Lumafield promises to revolutionize the way complex products are created, manufactured, and used across industries. We started with industrial CT scanning, which for us was the most valuable but underutilized tool in the manufacturing toolbox, enabling us to rapidly inspect essential components non\\-destructively.  

  

We rebuilt the whole system, from X\\-ray capture, to computer vision analysis, to web\\-based collaboration, to the entire business model, making the most advanced manufacturing tech more accessible to every industry. Our company, like our platform, is designed for upgrades. We’re building for greater intelligence, autonomy, and speed. For deeper vision, operational excellence, and powerful insights. And then we'll upgrade it all again.  

  

Lumafield is headquartered in Cambridge, MA, and has an office in San Francisco, CA.  

  

**About the role:**  

We are looking for a Technical Product Marketing Manager who can bridge the gap between cutting\\-edge technology and compelling storytelling. You will develop messaging, create technical content, and drive go\\-to\\-market strategies that educate and inspire engineers, product creators, and manufacturing executives across industries.  

This role requires a deep understanding of the manufacturing world—everything from how engineers approach product development to how factory managers think about quality control—as well as the ability to translate complex technical concepts into clear, impactful narratives that resonate with our customers.
### **What you'll do:**

* Develop and refine value propositions, messaging, customer personas, and competitive positioning for Lumafield’s X\\-ray CT scanners and AI\\-powered analysis software.
* Collaborate with Lumafield’s product management, content marketing, and growth marketing teams to identify target audiences and content needs
* Create informative, well\\-targeted technical content from beginning to end. Conduct research; generate differentiated demo scan assets; work with our content team to produce white papers, blog posts, and videos; work with our growth team to distribute your content through ad campaigns and partnerships; and work with our events team to create targeted trade show collateral.
* Plan and execute product launches: develop product positioning, produce illustrative scans, and work with our content team to create impactful web copy, white papers, and videos
* Work closely with our sales team and create compelling sales enablement materials, including datasheets, battle cards, and presentations
* Meet with customers, understand how they interact with our marketing program, and lead the development of case studies and customer stories
* Conduct competitive analysis and serve as an in\\-house expert on related companies and technologies

### **About you:**

* Formal engineering degree or equivalent informal engineering experience
* 3\\+ years of experience in product marketing
* Enthusiastic curiosity about how things are made
* Excellent writing and presentation skills
* Excellent project management skills
* Ability to work cross\\-functionally with our Product, Sales, and Engineering teams

**About Reducto**
*Nearly 80% of enterprise data is in unstructured formats like PDFs*
 PDFs are the status quo for enterprise knowledge in nearly every industry. Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that’s simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn’t an inconvenience—it’s a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week.
   

  

*Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFs*
 OCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with.
   

  

 Reducto Breaks Document Layouts Into Subsections And Then Contextually Parses Each Depending On The Type Of Content. This Is Made Possible By a Combination Of Vision Models, LLMs, And a Suite Of Heuristics We Built Over Time. Put Simply, We Can Help You
   

  

* Accurately extract text and tables even with nonstandard layouts
* Automatically convert graphs to tabular data and summarize images in documents
* Extract important fields from complex forms with simple, natural language instructions
* Build powerful retrieval pipelines using Reducto’s document metadata
* Intelligently chunk information using the document’s layout data

 We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
   

  

 We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
   

  

 Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays \\& Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

* Holistic Problem Solver: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building.
* Communicate with Care: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time.

You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth and the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.
* Impact Driven: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Work isn't a solo endeavor for you, and you enjoy collaborating cross\\-functionally to accomplish shared goals.


**Nice To Haves**
* You understand how parts of a system fit together, from the user interface to the data model. You are familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL, and have experience building products from ground up.
* You’re proficient with data pipeline technologies: Spark, DBT, etc
* You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.
* You have experience driving teams toward shared goals and can balance business priorities with individuals’ strengths, areas of interest, and career development goals.

We're driven by the opportunity to reimagine what it's like to drive and make travel safer, less stressful, and more enjoyable for everyone.



When you join the Latitude team, you'll work alongside leading experts across machine learning and robotics, cloud platforms, mapping, sensors and compute systems, test operations, systems and safety engineering – ***all dedicated to making a real, positive impact on the driving experience for millions of people.***



As a Ford Motor Company subsidiary, we operate independently to develop automated driving technology at the speed of a technology startup. Latitude is headquartered in Pittsburgh with engineering centers in Dearborn, Mich., and Palo Alto, Calif.


**Meet the team:**



The Virtual Test Ecosystem (VTE) team is responsible for implementing the tooling used by Latitude to perform simulations (pure virtual scenarios where we can control interactions and sweep over permutations via a descriptive scenario language) and resimulations (rerunning logs collected on\\-vehicle using an updated version of the autonomy stack). This includes the backend C\\+\\+ simulation/resimulation frameworks that call the underlying autonomy tasks and Python\\-based tooling to run this at large scale in the cloud. This infrastructure enables us to do a large portion of testing before the code ever makes it on vehicle, dramatically reducing autonomy developer iteration time and allowing us to perform large scale safety testing.



We work closely and iteratively with autonomy teams to build out new sim/resim features that they need in order to evaluate their new autonomy features. Similarly, we work hand\\-in\\-hand with the offboard testing teams who are building out test coverage to ensure they can use our tooling to write the tests they need and to get feedback on how we can make this test creation more efficient. And of course we're constantly benchmarking and evaluating the efficiency and scalability of our applications in order to reduce runtimes and cost.


**What you'll do:**


* Add new features needed by autonomy teams and/or testing to the core C\\+\\+ simulation / resimulation framework. This could be a more complex interaction with other actors or some feature of the map. It could also be simulating a new portion of the autonomy stack, or intentionally introducing a degradation to some portion of the stack in order to determine how downstream components react
* Work directly with autonomy and testing teams to understand their needs and pain points, then internally propose features we can add to improve our infrastructure and/or simulation realism
* Support troubleshooting with users and bug fixes when issues are identified; we work with a variety of users on a daily basis
* Analyze simulation/resimulation reproducibility (does running the same code multiple times result in the exact same behavior?) and develop tooling to root\\-cause whether nondeterminism is coming from autonomy tasks or from the simulation/resimulation code
* Learn the autonomy stack at a level of depth that allows you to reason about what the best way is to wire in new autonomy features as they're developed, to be able to do some initial root\\-causing of crashes or issues to isolate what's going wrong (at which point the associated autonomy team would implement the actual fix), and in general to be an effective bridge between our team and the autonomy teams


**What you'll need to succeed:**


* Expertise in modern C\\+\\+ (C\\+\\+17\\)
* Self\\-driven to write code that's efficient, well\\-tested, well\\-documented, and conforms to our style guide
* 3\\+ years' experience with developing software for autonomous vehicles
* 1\\+ years' experience with developing software for some sort of simulation environment
* Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Robotics or a related field and 4\\+ years of relevant experience (or Master's degree and 2\\+ years of relevant experience, or PhD)
* Strong communication skills and desire to partner with internal and external team members in order to create solutions that robustly solve the problem and allow us to evaluate the safety and performance of new features


**Nice to have:**


* Python development experience
* AWS or similar cloud experience


**What we offer you:**


* Competitive compensation packages
* High\\-quality individual and family medical, dental, and vision insurance
* Health savings account with available employer match
* Employer\\-matched 401(k) retirement plan with immediate vesting

 We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
   

  

 We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
   

  

 Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays \\& Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
   

  

**About The Role**
 Imagine yourself in the 1970s or 80s thinking through how computing should look and feel for people who had never seen one before. That's what we're trying to do at Notion — make software that feels timeless, with the craftsmanship of German cameras, playfulness of Japanese toys, and mass appeal of Coca\\-Cola. We have no end of fascinating challenges that can only be solved by someone with innate product \\& UX sense, technical aptitude, great taste, and impeccable craft.
   

  

**What You'll Achieve**
* Design product concepts that balance vision, craft, speed, and business potential.
* Craft every detail of new product features, from idea to UX to pixel\\-perfect execution.
* Run projects end to end with engineers to drive your vision to the ship line.
* Partner closely with our Customer Experience, Sales, and Customer Success teams to understand what each of our diverse user segments need, want, and love about Notion. Use this data and acquired intuition to prioritize, plan, and scope our product roadmap.
* Work with Marketing to devise new ways to tell great stories throughout the user lifecycle, and across our site, product, help guides and other channels.
* Create new patterns that are intuitive, practical, and convergent. Evolve our design system intentionally as we scale.


**Skills You'll Need To Bring**
* You have well\\-rounded skills and experience to run projects independently end to end. 5\\+ years of working experience.
* You seek to understand the needs of customers then explore and advocate for the strongest user experiences to solve their problems
* You enjoy untangling vague conceptual problems and have a sharp intuition for the most accessible mental models and flows, so users can immediately start gaining value out of the product.
* You create clear, intuitive, and visually appealing human interfaces.
* You care about business needs, implications, and practicality of your designs. You don't get stuck on pretty UI or deep abstractions and can balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.
* You have strong beliefs, loosely held. You're a good listener who collaborates well with different stakeholders. You observe and internalize all inputs and feedback to help you reach an optimal decision.
* You understand how to tell stories using both words and visuals, and strategize the best ways to drive alignment.
* You value working cross\\-functionally with project management, engineering, research and data — as well as design peers.


**Nice To Haves**
* You've designed and built great tools with small teams in the past.
* You bring unique strengths and perspectives to the team. We're looking to build a diverse team where our skills and experience can complement each other.
* You've experienced the pain of fragmented tools and information silos created by them, and have a strong urge to fix it.
* You're familiar with the work of computing heroes like Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, Bret Victor, etc. — and understand why we're big fans.
* You are a designer who can code!

 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
   

  

 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.

The ideal candidate isn't just a skilled engineer they're a builder who sees beyond code to understand the larger business and human impact of their work.
   

  

**About Us**
 Waterlily uses AI to help families prepare for the largest financial and medical event in their lives, long\\-term care (LTC). Through comprehensive care planning and optimization, Waterlily is bending Americas multi\\-trillion dollar LTC cost curve.
   

  

 Our Team \\& Culture
   

  

 We've built a high\\-performance team culture based on three core principles:
   

  

**Mission\\-Driven Excellence**
* We're deeply committed to transforming how families prepare for long\\-term care
* Every team member genuinely believes in our mission and understands its importance
* We prioritize work that drives meaningful impact for our customers and company


**Be a Potato: Growth \\& Resilience**
* We embrace challenges and adapt quickly \\- like potatoes that grow under any circumstances
* We make decisions swiftly while remaining thoughtful and open to iteration
* We focus on execution and results rather than just effort, recognizing that input doesn't necessarily equal output
* We value team members who show unlimited potential for growth and understanding


**Radical Transparency \\& Support**

* Feedback flows freely in all directions \\- from intern to leadership and back
* We begin meetings with brief check\\-ins to understand each other's context
* We create safe spaces for vulnerability and authentic collaboration
* We maintain high standards while supporting each other's growth and wellbeing


 Our team comprises some of the brightest, most ambitious, playful, and friendly people youll meet. You'll be working closely with our founding Waterlily team, including Lily, Evan, Job, and Tim, and have direct access to a support team in the Philippines.
   

  

* Lily Vittayarukskul, our CEO, is a patented inventor who started college at 14, attending UC Berkeley, was working at NASA when she was 16, and lead product and engineering at IoT medical device startups for years before founding Waterlily.
* Evan Ehrenberg, our COO, is a member of Forbes 30 Under 30, started college at 11, also attending UC Berkeley, and then continued on to his Ph.D. in computational neuroscience at MIT at 16 before dropping out at 21 to found Clara Health, a clinical trials SaaS platform and B2B2C marketplace, which he sold 7 years later before joining Waterlily.
* Our founding engineer and data scientist, Tim Chung, holds a Masters of Computer Science from UPenn and is midway through a Data Science Masters at Georgia Tech. Tim excels in a trio of roles: data scientist, machine learning engineer, and full\\-stack software engineer. At his previous companies, he led teams to launch pioneering machine learning models.
* Our head of operations, Job Lawrence, holds a Masters from Harvard and MBA from the University of Michigan, worked directly alongside Sundar Pichai at early Google for over 10 years where he led strategy and operations, and has run finance, strategy, and ops for startups ranging from the earliest founding stages through Series D funding and beyond.


 How We Work
   

  

* We optimize for remote\\-first collaboration while maintaining high productivity
* We emphasize contextual decision\\-making and practical solutions
* We prioritize deep work and focused execution over unnecessary meetings
* We consistently validate that we're working on the highest\\-impact initiatives
* We maintain a healthy, growth\\-oriented mindset while pushing for exceptional results


 We're looking for teammates who share our values of integrity, empathy, and intelligent hard work \\- people who can see beyond their immediate role to understand both company needs and customer impact.
   

  

**About You**
**Growth Mindset \\& Adaptability**
* You're a ""potato"" \\- able to grow and thrive under any circumstances
* You have a track record of rapidly learning new technologies and business domains
* You see challenges as opportunities and adapt quickly to changing priorities
* You're comfortable with ambiguity and can make swift, informed decisions


**Innovation \\& Execution**
* You have a history of building solutions that challenge traditional approaches
* You can point to specific examples where you've used automation or AI to multiply your impact
* You focus on getting things done rather than achieving perfection on the first try
* You have experience or strong interest in leveraging LLMs and offshore teams as force multipliers


**Leadership \\& Communication**
* You give and receive direct feedback with grace and professionalism
* You can clearly explain complex technical concepts to non\\-technical stakeholders
* You're comfortable leading discussions and driving decisions
* You naturally build trust through transparency and reliable execution


**Mission Alignment**
* You're drawn to meaningful work that impacts families' lives
* You understand that sustained high performance requires maintaining personal wellbeing
* You're excited about joining a team that values both ambitious goals and sustainable pace
* You're genuinely interested in transforming how families prepare for long\\-term care


 The Ideal Background
   

  

 While we value potential over experience, you likely have:
   

  

* Demonstrated ability to own and deliver full\\-stack projects end\\-to\\-end
* Experience with modern web development frameworks and cloud architecture
* Track record of improving team efficiency through automation and process innovation
* History of taking initiative and driving results without extensive oversight


 We're not looking for someone who's done it all before we're looking for someone who has the raw talent and drive to help us pioneer new approaches to software development and team collaboration. If you're excited about pushing boundaries, learning rapidly, and making a real difference in people's lives, we want to talk to you.
   

  

**About The Role**
 You will be tasked with owning and scaling mission\\-critical features across the entire software stack. The goal will be to push beyond industry best\\-practices in software development by innovating new strategies that leverage LLMs and offshore teams to achieve company\\-defining results for a fraction of the time and cost of what other companies have previously achieved.
   

  

 You will be working with our founding US\\-based team and report directly to our co\\-founder and COO, Evan Ehrenberg, and you will grow to work with and support the management of a team of 40\\+ in the Philippines. You will collaborate on new ideas and implement quickly to test and iterate. Many ideas will not work and will be thrown away. Many ideas will need to be imperfect so that we can implement them faster. Everything will be iterative, no challenge will be too ambitious.
   

  

 You will be challenged to produce meaningful results every week. It will likely take you more than 40 hours per week to drive industry\\-leading results. We do not think that 80 hour weeks are sustainable or effective in the long run, and so while there may be incredibly important times where we mutually decide to be opportunistic to push ourselves to that amount of work to accomplish something very time sensitive, we expect you to generally limit yourself to 50\\-60 hour work\\-weeks. If you want to push harder we will urge you to reflect on ways to be more effective with your time so that you can dedicate your remaining time to benefit your mental and physical health.
   

  

 We will be in the trenches with you, and together we will create one of the most impactful companies that will help families prepare for what has historically been one of the most devastating times in their lives so that they can face long\\-term care with confidence and calm.

**Meet the team:**



The Virtual Test Ecosystem (VTE) team is responsible for implementing the tooling used by Latitude to perform simulations (pure virtual scenarios where we can control interactions and sweep over permutations via a descriptive scenario language) and resimulations (rerunning logs collected on\\-vehicle using an updated version of the autonomy stack). This includes the backend C\\+\\+ simulation/resimulation frameworks that call the underlying autonomy tasks and Python\\-based tooling to run this at large scale in the cloud. This infrastructure enables us to do a large portion of testing before the code ever makes it on vehicle, dramatically reducing autonomy developer iteration time and allowing us to perform large scale safety testing.



We work closely and iteratively with autonomy teams to build out new sim/resim features that they need in order to evaluate their new autonomy features. Similarly, we work hand\\-in\\-hand with the offboard testing teams who are building out test coverage to ensure they can use our tooling to write the tests they need and to get feedback on how we can make this test creation more efficient. And of course we're constantly benchmarking and evaluating the efficiency and scalability of our applications in order to reduce runtimes and cost.


**What you'll do:**


* Add new features needed by autonomy teams and/or testing to the core C\\+\\+ simulation / resimulation framework. This could be a more complex interaction with other actors or some feature of the map. It could also be simulating a new portion of the autonomy stack, or intentionally introducing a degradation to some portion of the stack in order to determine how downstream components react
* Work directly with autonomy and testing teams to understand their needs and pain points, then internally propose features we can add to improve our infrastructure and/or simulation realism
* Support troubleshooting with users and bug fixes when issues are identified; we work with a variety of users on a daily basis
* Analyze simulation/resimulation reproducibility (does running the same code multiple times result in the exact same behavior?) and develop tooling to root\\-cause whether nondeterminism is coming from autonomy tasks or from the simulation/resimulation code
* Learn the autonomy stack at a level of depth that allows you to reason about what the best way is to wire in new autonomy features as they're developed, to be able to do some initial root\\-causing of crashes or issues to isolate what's going wrong (at which point the associated autonomy team would implement the actual fix), and in general to be an effective bridge between our team and the autonomy teams


**What you'll need to succeed:**


* Expertise in modern C\\+\\+ (C\\+\\+17\\)
* Self\\-driven to write code that's efficient, well\\-tested, well\\-documented, and conforms to our style guide
* 3\\+ years' experience with developing software for autonomous vehicles
* 1\\+ years' experience with developing software for some sort of simulation environment
* Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Robotics or a related field and 4\\+ years of relevant experience (or Master's degree and 2\\+ years of relevant experience, or PhD)
* Strong communication skills and desire to partner with internal and external team members in order to create solutions that robustly solve the problem and allow us to evaluate the safety and performance of new features


**Nice to have:**


* Python development experience
* AWS or similar cloud experience


**What we offer you:**


* Competitive compensation packages

 We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
   

  

 We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
   

  

 Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays \\& Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
   

  

**About The Role**
 We are looking for an ML Engineer to join our small but nimble AI team whose mission is to make Notion an ML\\-powered product. As an ML Engineer, you will work on incorporating large language models (LLMs), embeddings, and other AI technologies into Notion’s product in a high quality way. You’ll be exploring the boundaries of what’s possible with ML technology and finding innovative ways to apply new industry learnings to Notion’s offering.
   

  

**What You'll Achieve**
* Work with the team to prototype and experiment with AI model quality improvements, either by fine tuning, prompt engineering, or building new models when needed
* Productionize and launch new AI technology integrations into Notion’s core product
* Collaborate with cross\\-functional teams to deliver product features on time
* Stay up\\-to\\-date with the latest AI technologies and trends


**Skills You'll Need To Bring**
* Domain Expert, Teacher and Learner: You have experience building AI products using LLMs, embeddings or other ML natural language technologies. 3\\+ years of experience in one or more of the following areas: machine learning, recommendation or ranking systems, natural language understanding/generation or artificial intelligence. You’re excited about bringing your pre\\-existing knowledge to the team, but you balance that with perpetual curiosity and understanding that there is always more to learn.
* Holistic Problem Solver: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building.
* Communicate with Care: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross\\-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth and the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.
* Impact Driven: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Work isn't a solo endeavor for you, and you enjoy collaborating cross\\-functionally to accomplish shared goals.


**Nice To Haves**
* You understand how parts of a system fit together, from the user interface to the data model. You are familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL, and have experience building products from ground up.
* You’re proficient with data pipeline technologies: Spark, DBT, etc
* You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.
* You have experience driving teams toward shared goals and can balance business priorities with individuals’ strengths, areas of interest, and career development goals.
* You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
* You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or literature.


 We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

* You have experience building predictive models and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness
* You're comfortable transforming raw data to build your own datasets if the metric you need doesn't exist yet
* You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy
* Strong communication and collaboration while working in cross\\-functional environments

* proven experience across C\\#, .NET Core and .NET Framework, web frameworks including MVC and Web API, SQL / SQL Server with proven experience in designing database schemas to satisfy data storage and retrieval requirements, designing and creating RESTful APIs, performing profiling of applications and writing performant code, Git, abstracting code into core libraries and creating reusable components, debugging and systems analysis, HTML5, CSS / SASS \\& Javascript and TypeScript, familiarity with a frontend framework such as Angular / React / Vue (Angular preferred)
* the ability to design systems characterised by medium levels of risk, impact and business or technical complexity, and the skills to select appropriate design standards, methods and tools to ensure they are applied effectively
* the ability to define the integration build, coordinate build activities across systems and understand how to undertake and support integration\\-testing activities
* an understanding of users and their needs, the ability to engage in meaningful interactions with them and the skills to propose design approaches or services to meet their needs
* a readiness to uphold the values of equality, diversity and inclusion
* the ability to pass security clearance, backed by the right to work in the UK

AI is the catalyst, Deepflow is the force.


Our mission? To empower human ingenuity in an age of artificial intelligence.


Are you looking for the challenge of a lifetime? Join our Founding Team.

 **About us:**


Deepflow is defining a new era of work. Our platform is the first ‘Human x Agentic orchestration layer’, seamlessly integrating human and artificial intelligence to redesign how companies operate and scale.


At the moment, despite AI’s staggering potential, teams struggle to wield its power. Even though 92% of Fortune 500 companies use GPTs, the impact on holistic output is negligible—less than a 1% shift. The problem is that AI is stuck at the task level.


The solution? A bold new paradigm: human\\-agentic teams. Our platform, Deepflow, empowers businesses to build, manage and scale human\\-agentic teams that have the speed and efficiency of AI and the nuance and alignment of humans.


Deepflow cuts through complexity to intelligently map, delegate, and complete slices of work, all from a simple prompt. Passing work from the right human to the right machine, and back again, in lightning time.


Our mission is bold: to enable any team to scale infinitely.

**About the role:**  

As part of our Founding Team, you’ll help define how AI orchestration works, looks and feels at scale.

**What you’ll do:**

* **Own and Build**: Take full ownership of your work, driving Deepflow forward with bold ideas, initiative and a drive that will keep pushing the boundaries

**Why this role matters:**  

Your contributions won’t just impact a product; they’ll redefine how businesses operate worldwide. In our fast\\-paced environment, the distance between your ideas and their impact is razor\\-thin. And as part of the founding team, you’ll influence the trajectory of Deepflow and play a critical role in our journey.  

  

We believe this is more than a job. It’s a chance to create something extraordinary—systems that empower businesses to scale beyond their limits by seamlessly integrating human intelligence with AI.

**What you'll need:**


Front\\-end:

* Working with front\\-end frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js

* Ability to work in a fast\\-paced environment with evolving requirements
* Strong analytical skills and attention to detail

 You'll work alongside a talented group who embrace each other's differences and aren't afraid of a challenge. We recognise our achievements, learn from our mistakes, and help each other to be the best we can be. Together, we're making insurance matter.

Over the past few years our member base has grown steadily, and we’re still going. We’re always looking to acquire new members, and to do that we need the best people in our team.
   

  

 Our bright and modern gaff is in Uxbridge, in leafy West London. But if commuting isn’t your favourite, most of our roles can be hybrid or work from home, or anywhere in between. If you like coming in, you’ll always find some office buddies. And if you like big occasions, we really bring the office to life monthly for our themed culture days. Plus all our giffgaffers come together at our legendary giffgaff summer, birthday and Christmas celebrations.

That's why we believe in creating an equitable, fairer, more inclusive business that champions different ideas and perspectives. We may be sort\\-of\\-small but we're big on that caring, sharing thing \\& strive to create a supportive culture.
   

  

 As a lean organisation, our team is built of a diverse, spirited range of people who are multi\\-skilled, highly motivated and flexible.
   

  

 In return for your outstanding efforts, you'll be rewarded with a competitive salary and excellent benefits. We believe that hard work should be supported and recognised.

**Job Introduction**
--------------------

  

The BBC has been serving audiences online for more than 20 years. Across key products including BBC iPlayer, News, Sport, Weather and Sounds, we entertain, educate and inform audiences in their millions every day.

  


But behind the scenes we have work to do. We are making the shift from being a broadcaster that speaks to our audiences to becoming a service that is directly shaped by them and designed around their wants and needs. We are creating personalised content, products and services that bring the right content to the right people, at the right time: a personalised BBC. This will be our greatest leap since iPlayer, and that’s why it’s right at the top of our agenda.

  


At the BBC we see AI and data science as fundamental on that journey. We use these technologies to enrich our content, improve journalist workflows and power personalised experiences for millions of audience members.

  


To help drive this effort, we’re looking for a Principal Data Scientist to join the Content Publishing Data Science team in Product Group. The successful candidate will be a technical leader in a highly cross\\-functional team of data scientists, engineers, product managers and UX designers, working to build AI products from research to impactful production systems. The team has a focus on large language models and other generative AI technologies, which the BBC is using to support content production and audience engagement.

  


We are a friendly and supportive team, and we love that we get to work on interesting and important problems that have a real impact on the audience's experience and the future of the BBC.

* 1\\.5\\-hour technical presentation and behavioural interview covering relevant competencies for the role.
  


**Main Responsibilties**
------------------------

  

As a Principal Data Scientist, you will deliver value to BBC audiences by developing machine learning products at scale. We are looking for individuals who combine a breadth of knowledge with deep specialism in one or two areas. You will do hands\\-on coding work to develop, deploy and iterate on generative AI systems, lead architecture design, implement ideas from recent research papers, do code reviews and set best practice.

  


The successful candidate will also have strong interpersonal skills to lead projects involving several different teams, such as the data science \\& engineering, AI research, ML platform and user\\-facing application teams, and to effectively engage with editorial stakeholders.

  


Principal Data Scientists at the BBC are expected to have an impact both within their immediate team and across the wider BBC AI community: setting technical best practice, sharing knowledge, mentoring junior colleagues and shaping culture and ways of working.

  


**Are you the right candidate**
-------------------------------

  

Essential criteria:  

* Extensive hands\\-on experience in data science and machine learning.
* Strong coding skills, particularly in Python.
* Expertise in large language models/generative AI.
* Proven track record leading projects to deliver value in production.
* Ability to clearly communicate to both technical and non\\-technical audiences.

The BBC is committed to redeploying employees seeking suitable alternative employment within the BBC for different reasons and they will be given priority consideration ahead of other applicants. Priority consideration means for those employees seeking redeployment their application will be considered alongside anyone else at risk of redundancy, prior to any individuals being considered who are not at risk.

  


We don’t focus simply on what we do – we also care how we do it. Our values and the way we behave are important to us. Please make sure you’ve read about our values and behaviours here.

  


Diversity matters at the BBC. We have a working environment where we value and respect every individual's unique contribution, enabling all of our employees to thrive and achieve their full potential.

  


We want to attract the broadest range of talented people to be part of the BBC – whether that’s to contribute to our programming or our wide range of non\\-production roles. The more diverse our workforce, the better able we are to respond to and reflect our audiences in all their diversity.

  


We are committed to equality of opportunity and welcome applications from individuals, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, socio\\-economic background, religion and/or belief. We will consider flexible working requests for all roles, unless operational requirements prevent otherwise.

At the moment, despite AI’s staggering potential, teams struggle to wield its power. Even though 92% of Fortune 500 companies use GPTs, the impact on holistic output is negligible—less than a 1% shift. The problem is that AI is stuck at the task level.


The solution? A bold new paradigm: human\\-agentic teams. Our platform, Deepflow, empowers businesses to build, manage and scale human\\-agentic teams that have the speed and efficiency of AI and the nuance and alignment of humans.


Deepflow cuts through complexity to intelligently map, delegate, and complete slices of work, all from a simple prompt. Passing work from the right human to the right machine, and back again, in lightning time.

**Job Introduction**
--------------------

  

The BBC has been serving audiences online for more than 20 years. Across key products including BBC iPlayer, News, Sport, Weather and Sounds, we entertain, educate and inform audiences in their millions every day.

  


But behind the scenes we have work to do. We are making the shift from being a broadcaster that speaks to our audiences to becoming a service that is directly shaped by them and designed around their wants and needs. We are creating personalised content, products and services that bring the right content to the right people, at the right time: a personalised BBC. This will be our greatest leap since iPlayer, and that’s why it’s right at the top of our agenda.

  


At the BBC we see AI and data science as fundamental on that journey. We use these technologies to enrich our content, improve journalist workflows and power personalised experiences for millions of audience members.

  


To help drive this effort, we’re looking for a Principal Data Scientist to join the Content Publishing Data Science team in Product Group. The successful candidate will be a technical leader in a highly cross\\-functional team of data scientists, engineers, product managers and UX designers, working to build AI products from research to impactful production systems. The team has a focus on large language models and other generative AI technologies, which the BBC is using to support content production and audience engagement.

  


We are a friendly and supportive team, and we love that we get to work on interesting and important problems that have a real impact on the audience's experience and the future of the BBC.

  


**Interview Process**
---------------------

  

2 Interviews:  

* 30\\-minute hiring manager interview covering your motivations for applying, expectations about the role and your background and skills. This interview is also for you to ask questions about the role to see if it is a good fit.
* 1\\.5\\-hour technical presentation and behavioural interview covering relevant competencies for the role.
  


**Main Responsibilties**
------------------------

  

As a Principal Data Scientist, you will deliver value to BBC audiences by developing machine learning products at scale. We are looking for individuals who combine a breadth of knowledge with deep specialism in one or two areas. You will do hands\\-on coding work to develop, deploy and iterate on generative AI systems, lead architecture design, implement ideas from recent research papers, do code reviews and set best practice.

  


The successful candidate will also have strong interpersonal skills to lead projects involving several different teams, such as the data science \\& engineering, AI research, ML platform and user\\-facing application teams, and to effectively engage with editorial stakeholders.

  


Principal Data Scientists at the BBC are expected to have an impact both within their immediate team and across the wider BBC AI community: setting technical best practice, sharing knowledge, mentoring junior colleagues and shaping culture and ways of working.

  


**Are you the right candidate**
-------------------------------

  

Essential criteria:  

* Extensive hands\\-on experience in data science and machine learning.
* Strong coding skills, particularly in Python.
* Expertise in large language models/generative AI.
* Proven track record leading projects to deliver value in production.
* Ability to clearly communicate to both technical and non\\-technical audiences.
* Ability to work effectively in a cross\\-functional team.
  


Desirable experience:  

* Good knowledge of cloud services, ideally AWS.
* Experience with model lifecycle management and MLOps, including model deployment, versioning and monitoring.
* Good knowledge of code management and deployment best practices.
* Ability to mentor and support other team members.
  


You are encouraged to apply even if you don’t meet every one of the criteria above!

  


**About the BBC**
-----------------

  

The BBC is committed to redeploying employees seeking suitable alternative employment within the BBC for different reasons and they will be given priority consideration ahead of other applicants. Priority consideration means for those employees seeking redeployment their application will be considered alongside anyone else at risk of redundancy, prior to any individuals being considered who are not at risk.

  


We don’t focus simply on what we do – we also care how we do it. Our values and the way we behave are important to us. Please make sure you’ve read about our values and behaviours here.

  


Diversity matters at the BBC. We have a working environment where we value and respect every individual's unique contribution, enabling all of our employees to thrive and achieve their full potential.

  


We want to attract the broadest range of talented people to be part of the BBC – whether that’s to contribute to our programming or our wide range of non\\-production roles. The more diverse our workforce, the better able we are to respond to and reflect our audiences in all their diversity.

  


We are committed to equality of opportunity and welcome applications from individuals, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, socio\\-economic background, religion and/or belief. We will consider flexible working requests for all roles, unless operational requirements prevent otherwise.

Our mission? To empower human ingenuity in an age of artificial intelligence.


Are you looking for the challenge of a lifetime? Join our Founding Team.

 **About us:**


Deepflow is defining a new era of work. Our platform is the first ‘Human x Agentic orchestration layer’, seamlessly integrating human and artificial intelligence to redesign how companies operate and scale.


At the moment, despite AI’s staggering potential, teams struggle to wield its power. Even though 92% of Fortune 500 companies use GPTs, the impact on holistic output is negligible—less than a 1% shift. The problem is that AI is stuck at the task level.


The solution? A bold new paradigm: human\\-agentic teams. Our platform, Deepflow, empowers businesses to build, manage and scale human\\-agentic teams that have the speed and efficiency of AI and the nuance and alignment of humans.


Deepflow cuts through complexity to intelligently map, delegate, and complete slices of work, all from a simple prompt. Passing work from the right human to the right machine, and back again, in lightning time.


Our mission is bold: to enable any team to scale infinitely.

**About the role:**  

As part of our Founding Team, you’ll help define how AI orchestration works, looks and feels at scale. This is your chance to help shape a world\\-beating product and tackle what we believe is the most exciting challenge of our time: integrating exponentially smarter, alien intelligence into the workflows of every company on the planet.  

  

**What you’ll do:**

* **Innovate at the Cutting Edge**: Work alongside our CTO to create, design, and deploy the foundational systems of a platform that could transform a $1\\.5 trillion market

* **Collaborate Deeply**: Partner closely with our Machine Learning team to develop groundbreaking capabilities and seamlessly blend human and AI intelligence
* **Own and Build**: Take full ownership of your work, driving Deepflow forward with bold ideas, initiative and a drive that will keep pushing the boundaries

**Why this role matters:**  

Your contributions won’t just impact a product; they’ll redefine how businesses operate worldwide. In our fast\\-paced environment, the distance between your ideas and their impact is razor\\-thin. And as part of the founding team, you’ll influence the trajectory of Deepflow and play a critical role in our journey.  

  

We believe this is more than a job. It’s a chance to create something extraordinary—systems that empower businesses to scale beyond their limits by seamlessly integrating human intelligence with AI.

**What you'll need:**


Front\\-end:

* Building user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript
* Working with front\\-end frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js

* Optimising application performance and load times


Back\\-end:

**Job Introduction**
--------------------

  

The BBC has been serving audiences online for more than 20 years. Across key products including BBC iPlayer, News, Sport, Weather and Sounds, we entertain, educate and inform audiences in their millions every day.

  


But behind the scenes we have work to do. We are making the shift from being a broadcaster that speaks to our audiences to becoming a service that is directly shaped by them and designed around their wants and needs. We are creating personalised content, products and services that bring the right content to the right people, at the right time: a personalised BBC. This will be our greatest leap since iPlayer, and that’s why it’s right at the top of our agenda.

  


At the BBC we see AI and data science as fundamental on that journey. We use these technologies to enrich our content, improve journalist workflows and power personalised experiences for millions of audience members.

  


To help drive this effort, we’re looking for a Principal Data Scientist to join the Content Publishing Data Science team in Product Group. The successful candidate will be a technical leader in a highly cross\\-functional team of data scientists, engineers, product managers and UX designers, working to build AI products from research to impactful production systems. The team has a focus on large language models and other generative AI technologies, which the BBC is using to support content production and audience engagement.

  


We are a friendly and supportive team, and we love that we get to work on interesting and important problems that have a real impact on the audience's experience and the future of the BBC.

  


**Interview Process**
---------------------

  

2 Interviews:  

* 30\\-minute hiring manager interview covering your motivations for applying, expectations about the role and your background and skills. This interview is also for you to ask questions about the role to see if it is a good fit.
* 1\\.5\\-hour technical presentation and behavioural interview covering relevant competencies for the role.
  


**Main Responsibilties**
------------------------

  

As a Principal Data Scientist, you will deliver value to BBC audiences by developing machine learning products at scale. We are looking for individuals who combine a breadth of knowledge with deep specialism in one or two areas. You will do hands\\-on coding work to develop, deploy and iterate on generative AI systems, lead architecture design, implement ideas from recent research papers, do code reviews and set best practice.

  


The successful candidate will also have strong interpersonal skills to lead projects involving several different teams, such as the data science \\& engineering, AI research, ML platform and user\\-facing application teams, and to effectively engage with editorial stakeholders.

  


Principal Data Scientists at the BBC are expected to have an impact both within their immediate team and across the wider BBC AI community: setting technical best practice, sharing knowledge, mentoring junior colleagues and shaping culture and ways of working.

  


**Are you the right candidate**
-------------------------------

  

Essential criteria:  

* Extensive hands\\-on experience in data science and machine learning.
* Strong coding skills, particularly in Python.
* Expertise in large language models/generative AI.
* Proven track record leading projects to deliver value in production.
* Ability to clearly communicate to both technical and non\\-technical audiences.
* Ability to work effectively in a cross\\-functional team.
  


Desirable experience:  

* Good knowledge of cloud services, ideally AWS.
* Experience with model lifecycle management and MLOps, including model deployment, versioning and monitoring.
* Good knowledge of code management and deployment best practices.
* Ability to mentor and support other team members.
  


You are encouraged to apply even if you don’t meet every one of the criteria above!

The BBC is committed to redeploying employees seeking suitable alternative employment within the BBC for different reasons and they will be given priority consideration ahead of other applicants.

We don’t focus simply on what we do – we also care how we do it. Our values and the way we behave are important to us. Please make sure you’ve read about our values and behaviours here.

  


Diversity matters at the BBC. We have a working environment where we value and respect every individual's unique contribution, enabling all of our employees to thrive and achieve their full potential.

At the moment, despite AI’s staggering potential, teams struggle to wield its power. Even though 92% of Fortune 500 companies use GPTs, the impact on holistic output is negligible—less than a 1% shift. The problem is that AI is stuck at the task level.


The solution? A bold new paradigm: human\\-agentic teams. Our platform, Deepflow, empowers businesses to build, manage and scale human\\-agentic teams that have the speed and efficiency of AI and the nuance and alignment of humans.


Deepflow cuts through complexity to intelligently map, delegate, and complete slices of work, all from a simple prompt. Passing work from the right human to the right machine, and back again, in lightning time.

We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.
   

  

**About The Team**
 Our talented and diverse UX team delights users one design at a time, while building and enhancing a UX culture within Roku that nurtures our ongoing enrichment and elevates the UX maturity across the company and the industry. We believe that great user experiences come from people who have the vision to see the big picture on the macro side while still maintaining incredible attention to detail on the micro side. More than ability to keep the vision while managing the minutiae, we need someone who can play three\\-dimensional chess on the axes of what our customers need and what our world\\-class engineers can produce while keeping things as elegantly easy as possible.
   

  

**About The Role**
 Roku is looking for a seasoned UX Researcher to lead research initiatives focused on key viewer experiences, such as Search, Mobile, and Browse experiences. In this role, you will help the team ensure the experience of finding content to watch is simple and delightful for Roku viewers, all while balancing against the monetization of our product experiences such as through subscriptions revenue. There may be opportunities to support research in areas important to the Roku business.
   

  

 We’re looking for someone who can be an independent thinker and influencer of product/design direction, while being a great team player both on the large UX research team and on project teams.
   

  

 Outstanding user experiences come from people who have the vision to see the big picture while maintaining an incredible attention to detail. You will partner with product managers, work closely with engineering teams and internalize business goals – melding them together to design and deliver great products.

**The Roku Culture**
 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
   

  

 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.

 About Inspo 🧬
 



  





 Designing and developing highly interactive and aesthetic apps with complex functionality is time consuming and expensive. I tried ""NoCode"" platforms, yet I always found myself coding. As an experiment, I began developing design systems for creating pixel perfect UI and complex UX flows. While useful for visual prototypes, they were all useless for building real apps. I needed to find a way of seamlessly adding logic to the designs without having to write any code. 50\\+ prototypes later, I cracked it. Here's how, rather than coming up with my own algorithms for drag \\& drop logic, I looked to nature 🌱 . My innate interests lie in Neuroscience, Biology, Genomics, and Physics, so I thought why not model Inspo after living systems. Amazingly, it worked and now I need your help!

With a formal market size of \\>700B alone, we’ve got a lot more saving to do for our users.

 At Cleo, we're not just building another fintech app. We're embarking on a mission to fundamentally change humanity's relationship with money. Imagine a world where everyone, regardless of background or income, has access to a hyper\\-intelligent financial advisor in their pocket. That's the future we're creating.
   

  

 Cleo is a rare success story: a profitable, fast\\-growing unicorn with over $200 million in ARR and growing over 2x year\\-over\\-year. This isn't just a job; it's a chance to join a team of brilliant, driven individuals who are passionate about making a real difference. We have an exceptionally high bar for talent, seeking individuals who are not only at the top of their field but also embody our culture of collaboration and positive impact.
   

  

 If you’re driven by complex challenges that push your expertise, the chance to shape something truly transformative, and the potential to share in Cleo’s success as we scale, while growing alongside a company that’s scaling fast, this might be your perfect fit.
   

  

 Follow us on LinkedIn to keep up to date with new product features and insights from the team.
   

  

**About The Role**
 Machine Learning Engineers at Cleo work on building novel solutions to real\\-world problems. This really does vary but could be: creating chatbots to coach our users around their financial health, creating classifiers to better understand transaction data or even optimising transactions within our payments platform.
   

  

 Ultimately, we’re looking for a brilliant Machine Learning Engineer to join us on our mission to fight for the world's financial health. You’ll be leading technical work within a team of adaptable, creative and product\\-focused engineers, who train \\& integrate cutting edge machine learning across a variety of products and deploy them into production for millions of users. We understand our customers, we understand their pain, and we are passionate about helping them.
   

  

**What You’ll Be Doing**
* Training and fine\\-tuning models to help customers get more value from our chatbot and app through deeper personalisation, creating a smarter \\& more engaging experience, recommending the right content and features to make users love Cleo
* Deploying these models into our production environments using our in\\-house ML platform, which you can read about on our blog: Let's have an Espresso: MLOps at Cleo.
* Integrating LLMs hosted by OpenAI, Anthropic, GCP, AWS
* Working cross\\-functionally with backend engineers, data analysts, UX writers, product managers, and others to ship features that improve our users’ financial health
* Driving the adoption of appropriate state\\-of\\-the\\-art techniques for recommendation, message campaign optimisation, and contextual bandits.
* Communicating the team’s successes and learnings at the company level \\& beyond.
* Developing a holistic view of personalisation and user\\-level features across Cleo, taking the initiative to extend existing approaches to benefit new areas of the app and conversations.
* Supporting ML Engineers around problem framing, ML modelling, and evaluation


 Here Are Some Examples, Big And Small, Of The Kinds Of Product Feature Work Our ML Engineers Have Taken Part In Over The Last Year
   

  

* Designed and implemented AI agents to analyse and extract insights from users’ transactional data.
* Developed models to interpret transactional data, enhancing the understanding of users’ finances. Think about your bank statement—how often do you not recognise a transaction on first review?
* Created contextual intent classifiers to understand user conversations with Cleo, enabling tailored and accurate platform responses.
* Engineered ML models to identify and deliver relevant actions to users within Cleo, ensuring a seamless, context\\-aware conversational experience.
* Built models to evaluate risk in customer interactions with bank transaction features and user activities.
* Developed optimisation models to improve payment success rates for customers while minimising business costs, tackling this as a two\\-sided optimisation challenge.


 Whatever problem you tackle, and whichever team you join, your work will directly impact those most in need, helping to improve their financial health.
   

  

**What You’ll Need**
* 3\\-5 years of experience in data science, machine learning engineering, or related roles
* Excellent knowledge of both Data Science (python, SQL) and production tools
* Strong ability to communicate findings to non\\-technical stakeholders
* Experience deploying machine learning models into production; familiarity with Docker containers and container orchestration tools is a plus


**Nice to have**
* Experience with recommender systems, personalisation, or ad optimisation


**What do you get for all your hard work?**

- Work at one of the fastest\\-growing tech startups, backed by top VC firms, Balderton \\& EQT Ventures

- A clear progression plan. We want you to keep growing. That means trying new things, leading others, challenging the status quo and owning your impact. Always with our complete support.

- Flexibility. We can’t fight for the world’s financial health if we’re not healthy ourselves. We work with everyone to make sure they have the balance they need to do their best work

- Work where you work best. We’re a globally distributed team. If you live in London we have a hybrid approach, we’d love you to spend one day a week or more in our beautiful office. If you’re outside of London, we’ll encourage you to spend a couple of days with us a few times per year. And we’ll cover your travel costs, naturally.

- Other benefits;

* Company\\-wide performance reviews every 6 months

If there’s anything we can do to accommodate your specific situation, please let us know. UK App access: The Cleo app is no longer downloadable in the UK (but only until next year). If you’re an existing user, you’ll still have access to the app. But some features won’t be available (just for a little while). Why? 99% of our users are based in the US – where financial health is often overlooked. We’ve decided to shift our focus to where we can provide the most value and make the greatest impact for users who need it most. Then we’ll be able to apply what we learn to better support our UK users in the future.","Financial Services","https://uk.linkedin.com/company/cleo-ai","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQG5mCfEiIGPLg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1698326588601/cleo_ai_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=6TsRmCVwzrXxuXEEyGZ7Ao5SvXQGrJQf5ROgWmJkYKo",nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

* Analyse exploratoire des données et identification des enseignements
* Construction de segmentation permettant de détailler les analyses selon des profils types
* Construction de modèles prédictifs et/ou de scoring pour connaître les probabilités de participation au don
* Interroger et exploiter les données venant de sources différentes (comportement au don, réactions aux sollicitations marketing, données issues des réseaux sociaux, données de navigation sur le site web ou l’application mobile)

  

Pour mener à bien ces missions, vous maîtrisez les techniques suivantes et avez une expérience significative sur ces sujets (secteur de la santé ou secteur marchand) :

* Analyses statistiques : descriptives, temporelles, analyses factorielles, régression logistique, imputation multiple, modèles prédictifs non\\-linéaires
* Application de méthodes de machine learning : forêts aléatoires, boosting, cross\\-validation stratifiée

-------------------------------

*“Whatever you do – whether for work or pleasure – do it with passion! Live with passion,”* wrote Christian Dior.
  

Well before he embarked on his destiny as a couturier, Christian Dior was fascinated with art. The young Normandy native and several friends opened an art gallery when he was just 23\\. In 1938 he learned the métier of pattern cutter with Robert Piguet and three years later began working as a designer for Lucien Lelong. Right from the founding of his Maison in 1946, he transformed his dreams into irresistible creations, seeking to break with the somber war years by elevating pure joy. His visionary spirit celebrated and enchanted women the world over. In only ten years, Monsieur Dior revolutionized the conventions of elegance and femininity, designing collections infused with dreams.","Retail","https://fr.indeed.com/cmp/Christian-Dior","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/dad2d4518ae5ab7218bebf0c965b2646","https://www.dior.com/","30 avenue Montaigne, 75008 Paris","1,001 to 5,000","$500M to $1B (USD)",nan

-------------------------------

*“Whatever you do – whether for work or pleasure – do it with passion! Live with passion,”* wrote Christian Dior.
  

Well before he embarked on his destiny as a couturier, Christian Dior was fascinated with art. The young Normandy native and several friends opened an art gallery when he was just 23\\. In 1938 he learned the métier of pattern cutter with Robert Piguet and three years later began working as a designer for Lucien Lelong. Right from the founding of his Maison in 1946, he transformed his dreams into irresistible creations, seeking to break with the somber war years by elevating pure joy. His visionary spirit celebrated and enchanted women the world over. In only ten years, Monsieur Dior revolutionized the conventions of elegance and femininity, designing collections infused with dreams.","Retail","https://fr.indeed.com/cmp/Christian-Dior","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/dad2d4518ae5ab7218bebf0c965b2646","https://www.dior.com/","30 avenue Montaigne, 75008 Paris","1,001 to 5,000","$500M to $1B (USD)",nan

We are a SaaS software as a service company, and our content service platform AODocs is used by 500 customers, including large enterprises like Veolia, Equifax, Solvay or Air Liquide to manage their business critical documents. AODocs ensures that information is easily accessible by the people who need it, while being protected against unauthorized content and human errors, and that business processes are properly followed, with full traceability. For example, AODocs helps Google ensure the design documents of its data centers are properly controlled, accelerating the construction projects while avoiding costly mistakes.



AODocs is a growing and profitable company, recognized (by top analyst firm Gartner, and by its own customers) as one of the most modern solutions in a market populated by legacy, pre\\-cloud systems like OpenText, IBM Filenet, Hyland and others. This market is now being disrupted by the new generative AI technologies, which allows software to understand the content of a company’s documents, and thus to automate tasks that previously required human work, such as document tagging, data extraction from unstructured text, or analysis of complex documents.



We believe the generative AI will dramatically change the way companies create and use their business content, and since the beginning of the year, we have made it a priority to integrate this new technology in our product. The combination of the generative AI capabilities to understand and generate text, with our existing document management and workflow features, enables a large number of high value use cases, from contracts management to RFP responses, audit reports, or recruitment processes.



We have offices in Paris, Atlanta and Milan as well as people based all over the world (remote work). Part of the Group Revevol, we work in a very **collaborative** and **transparent** manner: key metrics are communicated broadly, on a weekly basis, and decisions are discussed collectively, not behind closed doors. We believe that good ideas can come from anyone, regardless of their formal job role. We are growing quickly, and looking for new talent that will help us reach new heights.


***Why are we recruiting?***



We are opening a new location in the EU to host our application and provide to our customers a GDPR compliant platform, and we want to provide a global approach to the infrastructure as code for all teams in the group. We are looking for highly motivated DevOps Engineer who will be part of our team in Europe. The candidate will be closed with our international development teams in the USA, Italy, Hungary, and France.

We are a SaaS software as a service company, and our content service platform AODocs is used by 500 customers, including large enterprises like Veolia, Equifax, Solvay or Air Liquide to manage their business critical documents. AODocs ensures that information is easily accessible by the people who need it, while being protected against unauthorized content and human errors, and that business processes are properly followed, with full traceability. For example, AODocs helps Google ensure the design documents of its data centers are properly controlled, accelerating the construction projects while avoiding costly mistakes.



AODocs is a growing and profitable company, recognized (by top analyst firm Gartner, and by its own customers) as one of the most modern solutions in a market populated by legacy, pre\\-cloud systems like OpenText, IBM Filenet, Hyland and others. This market is now being disrupted by the new generative AI technologies, which allows software to understand the content of a company’s documents, and thus to automate tasks that previously required human work, such as document tagging, data extraction from unstructured text, or analysis of complex documents.



We believe the generative AI will dramatically change the way companies create and use their business content, and since the beginning of the year, we have made it a priority to integrate this new technology in our product. The combination of the generative AI capabilities to understand and generate text, with our existing document management and workflow features, enables a large number of high value use cases, from contracts management to RFP responses, audit reports, or recruitment processes.



We have offices in Paris, Atlanta and Milan as well as people based all over the world (remote work). Part of the Group Revevol, we work in a very **collaborative** and **transparent** manner: key metrics are communicated broadly, on a weekly basis, and decisions are discussed collectively, not behind closed doors. We believe that good ideas can come from anyone, regardless of their formal job role. We are growing quickly, and looking for new talent that will help us reach new heights.


***Why are we recruiting?***



We are opening a new location in the EU to host our application and provide to our customers a GDPR compliant platform, and we want to provide a global approach to the infrastructure as code for all teams in the group. We are looking for highly motivated DevOps Engineer who will be part of our team in Europe. The candidate will be closed with our international development teams in the USA, Italy, Hungary, and France.

Most of these have individuals posing as representatives of prominent companies, including Owkin, with the aim of obtaining personal, sensitive, or financial information from applicants. These scams prey upon an individual’s desire to obtain a job and can sometimes “feel” like a genuine recruitment process. Some red flags are identified below. Should you encounter a recruitment process that claims to be for Owkin but is not consistent with the below, please do not provide any personal or financial information:
* Legitimate Owkin recruitment processes include communication with candidates through recognized professional networks, such as LinkedIn.
* Communication is always through an official Owkin email address (from the @owkin.com domain), over the phone or though our applicant tracking system (Greenhouse).
* The Owkin talent team do use platforms such as LinkedIn and Job Teaser, however if you have any concern or doubt about this contact, please ask for them to send an email from @Owkin.com.
* The Owkin talent team will not solicit personal data from candidates during the application phase including, but not limited to, date of birth, social security numbers, or bank account information;
* Legitimate Owkin interviews may be conducted over the phone, in person, or via an approved enterprise videoconferencing service (Google Meets). They will not occur via Signal, Telegram or Messenger
* Owkin offers of employment are based on merit and only extended once a candidate has interviewed with members of the talent and hiring team. Offers will be extended both verbally and in written format.

 : tous les candidats ont leur place chez Deloitte. Nous croyons en un environnement inclusif dans lequel les personnes se sentent impliquées, respectées, valorisées, et capables d’apporter leur « soi authentique ». La lutte contre toute forme de discrimination, l’égalité des chances, le respect et la mise en valeur de la diversité sont les pierres angulaires de notre politique RH.

(Les “B Corp” formant une communauté de sociétés qui ont décidé d’être non pas les meilleures du monde mais les meilleures POUR le monde).
   

  

 Parce que notre développement repose sur des principes forts :
   

  

* Un profond respect de l’ensemble de nos parties prenantes : consultant(e)s, clients et fournisseurs. Car si le travail “ne fait pas le bonheur”, il peut cependant “faire le malheur”. Nous nous engageons donc à écouter et agir avec honnêteté.
* Une égalité des chances dans le traitement de nos candidatures et dans la gestion de carrière de nos salarié(e)s. Nous croyons en un milieu de travail où équité F/H, inclusion et diversité sont la norme.
* Une empreinte environnementale minimale, et sociétale maximale. C’est pourquoi, au\\-delà des missions que vous réaliserez, vous pourrez également contribuer à des projets que Davidson soutient : missions de solidarité internationale (avec Planète Urgence), bénévolat auprès d’associations (chaque Davidsonien(ne) dispose de 3 jours par an pour intervenir à leurs côtés), accompagnement d’étudiant(e)s issus de milieux peu favorisés (avec Article 1\\), investissement dans des startups développant des solutions innovantes, actions collectives et individuelles pour la réduction de notre impact carbone…
* Un Management adhocratique basé sur la mise en œuvre des principes de “l’entreprise horizontale” et du “management tribal”. Sur ce dernier point une précision d’importance : le bien\\-être au travail est un luxe qu’il faut pouvoir s’offrir en étant une entreprise “solide”. Ceci induit pour les Davidsonien(ne)s d’allier prises d’initiative, engagement et professionnalisme. Car “sans travail, le talent n’est qu’une sale manie”. Et cela nous incite à chercher à recruter des personnes… meilleures que nous…


 Nous encourageons les candidatures de personnes en situation de handicap, et nous nous engageons à répondre au mieux à leurs besoins spécifiques.

**About Stripe**
 Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.
   

  

**About The Team**
 Stripe is beloved by developers for the simplicity of our APIs, the thoroughness of our documentation, and our focus on developer experience. The Technical Solutions Engineering (TSE) team is the glue that supports our developers and champions developer experience as being central to the overall experience of our users. TSE interacts directly with developers more than any other team at Stripe, so your role will have a significant impact on what Stripe is known for and values most. When we do our job well, developers all over the world are able to smoothly launch and grow their businesses on Stripe, whether they’re integrating payments for the first time or building complex financial systems.
   

  

 What you’ll do
   

  

 TSEs understand the fundamentals of programming incredibly well and eagerly jump in and familiarize themselves with others’ code. You will do a wide variety of things, including explaining technical concepts about Stripe’s services, build and debug integrations with developers, and produce/improve guides that help our users solve particular problems to be successful with Stripe. You will interact with developers of all skill levels through a variety of mediums, enabling them to be successful when using Stripe.
   

  

 Early on, current team members will devote a large amount of time to teaching you and helping you get to a level of comfort and expertise with Stripe, its services, and how we interact with users. Later, we’d love for you to take on this role with others on the team and Stripes broadly, as teaching is a great way to learn and to reinforce what you know.
   

  

 If you’re someone who enjoys working with all kinds of code, a fast researcher, a strong writer, and enthusiastic about helping others build mission\\-critical products with Stripe, we want to hear from you!
   

  

**Responsibilities**
* Communicate with a number of external developers and aid them in building their applications against Stripe’s infrastructure in a number of programming languages (including Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go, NodeJS, .NET, ReactJS, React Native, Swift, Objective\\-C, Kotlin, and Java for Android).
* Unblock external developers with their thorniest integration challenges through a variety of support channels including email, ticketing software, internal issue trackers, community platforms (like StackOverflow), and real\\-time chat software (like Slack and Discord)
* Develop and maintain internal and external documentation, examples, integration demos, and code\\-snippets that demonstrate usage patterns of the Stripe infrastructure.
* Identify points of friction developers encounter and collaborate with engineering teams to make Stripe products better. Participate in a number of extended engineering teams’ regular planning sessions, design reviews, and development meetings.
* Develop and maintain a suite of internal support tooling for TSE and Stripe Support more broadly e.g. a retrieval augmented generation LLM\\-based Copilot tool or the Invoice Explainer Admin tool.
* Act as a developer advocate and educational resource internal to the organization by regularly assembling training for non\\-developers internal to the organization and responding in real\\-time to product integration questions.


 Who you are
   

  

 We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.
   

  

**Minimum Requirements**
* At least 4 years of full\\-stack software development experience, with a proven track record of building web or mobile applications that deliver high\\-quality user experiences
* Direct experience explaining technical concepts, and would be comfortable explaining how Stripe works to both technical and non\\-technical audiences
* Understands how to write good, clean code in multiple programming languages, as well as how to read code that might not be quite as well written
* Ability to help users during working hours in the region you are in. This may occasionally include providing weekend coverage for monitoring/supporting critical infrastructure, which TSEs are uniquely equipped to assist with given the team’s knowledge around Stripe’s products and active integrations. The team is largely remote, and we are very supportive of working arrangements that allow for family care and other needs to be met.


**Preferred Qualifications**
* Enjoys writing in a clear and quick manner
* General software engineering skills are important to us, as we understand that new languages and frameworks can be learned if you understand the concepts
* Experience teaching or coaching developers
* Comfort working with a great deal of autonomy and limited supervision
* Degree in Computer Science, Software/Computer Engineering, or a related analytical field of study

*“Whatever you do – whether for work or pleasure – do it with passion! Live with passion,”* wrote Christian Dior.
  

Well before he embarked on his destiny as a couturier, Christian Dior was fascinated with art. The young Normandy native and several friends opened an art gallery when he was just 23\\. In 1938 he learned the métier of pattern cutter with Robert Piguet and three years later began working as a designer for Lucien Lelong. Right from the founding of his Maison in 1946, he transformed his dreams into irresistible creations, seeking to break with the somber war years by elevating pure joy. His visionary spirit celebrated and enchanted women the world over. In only ten years, Monsieur Dior revolutionized the conventions of elegance and femininity, designing collections infused with dreams.","Retail","https://fr.indeed.com/cmp/Christian-Dior","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/dad2d4518ae5ab7218bebf0c965b2646","https://www.dior.com/","30 avenue Montaigne, 75008 Paris","1,001 to 5,000","$500M to $1B (USD)",nan
